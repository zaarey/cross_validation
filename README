# Cross Validation Model Comparison on Iris Dataset

This project uses the Iris dataset to compare the performance of three different machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest Classifier. The models are evaluated using cross-validation to determine the best fit for the dataset.

## Project Workflow
1. Loaded the Iris dataset using Scikit-learn.
2. Applied the cross_val_score function to perform cross-validation on three models:
    - Logistic Regression (with 2000 iterations)
    - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    - Random Forest Classifier
3. Calculated the average cross-validation score for each model.
4. Compared the results to determine the best-performing model.

## Libraries Used
- Pandas: For data manipulation. 
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and cross-validation.

```bash
import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
 ```
## Installations
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```
## Results

**Logistic Regression**: 97% accuracy (average cross-validation score)
**SVM**: 96% accuracy
**Random Forest**: 96% accuracy

Based on these results, the model with the highest average score 'logistic regression model' is considered the best fit for the Iris dataset.
